# ** Exponent 
## you can raise a number by an exponentiation operator
2 ** 2 
# evaluates to 4 

# % Modulus/remainder
14 % 4 
# evaluates to 2

## When you use modulo on two numbers, 
## if there is no remainder (modulo returns 0), the number is even.
## If there is a remainder, the number is odd.
12 % 2
# evaluates to 0
11 % 2
# evaluates to 1

# // Integer division/floored quotient
## returns the quotient
13 // 8
# evaluates to 1

# / Division
## returns the result as a floating-point number
13 / 8 
# evaluates to 1.625

# * Multiplcation
8 * 2
# evaluates to 16

# - Subtraction 
7 - 1
# evaluates to 6

# + Addition
2 + 2
# evaluates to 4

# Operands
## The values on either side of an operator are called operands.

# Expression
## Together, two operands and an operator form an expression
## On execution, Python evaluates each expression and returns a single value. 

# The order of operation
## set of rules used in mathematical calculations to evaludate an expression
## Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally!
## Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplcation, Division, Addition, and, Subtraction
