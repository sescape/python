# Constants and Variables

# You can use Python to do math, just like you would a calculator.

# You can add, subtract, divide, multiple, raise a number to a power, and much more
2 + 2
2 - 2
4 / 2
2 * 2

# Constant
## A constant is a value that never changes.
## Each of the numbers above is a constant.

# Variable
## A variable referes to a value that can change.
## A variable consists of a name made up of one or more characters.
## The name is assigned a value using the assignment operator (the = sign)
## You create a variable simply by assigning a value to it with the assignment operator
b = 100
b

## Changing the value of a variable
x = 100
x 
x = 200
x

## Two varaible to perform arithmetic operations:
x = 10
y = 10
z = x + y
a = x - y
a

## incrementing/decrementing the value of a variable
x = 10
x = x + 1
x
x += 1
x

x = 10
x = x - 1
x 
x -= 1
x

## more variables 
hi = "Hello, World!"
my_float = 7.2
my_boolean = True

## Naming a variable
### Variables can't have spaces. Use underscore when variable has two words
### Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and the underscore symbol
### You cannnot start a variable name with a number.
### A variable name can start with an underscore.
### You cannot use Python keywords for variable names. Keyword list at http://theselftaughtprogrammer.io/keywords
