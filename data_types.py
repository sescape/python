# data types

# In Python, each data value is called an object.
# An object as a data value in Python has three properties: identity, data type, and value
## Identity is its location in your computer's memory, which never changes
## The data type of an object is the category of data the object belongs to, which determines
## the properties the object has and never changes.
## The value of an object is the data it represents 

"Hello World"
# Hello World is an object with the data type str, short for string and the value "Hello World"

# String
## When you refer to an object with the data type str, you call it a string.
## A String is a sequence of one or more characters surrounded by quotes.
## You can use single quotes or double quotes, but the quotes at the beginning and end of a string 
## must match
## Strings are used to represent text, and they have unique properties.

# Character
## A character is a single symbol like a or 1

# int
## whole numbers (1,2,3,..) have the data type int, short for integer

# float
## Decimal number (number with a decimal point) have a data type called float

# bool
## objects with a bool data type are called booleans, and have a value of True or False
True
False

# NoneType
## objects with a data type NoneType always have the value None.
## They are used to represent the absence of value
None
